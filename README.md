# Primer

Cross-platform Primer React components. Render Primer components to React web, React Native, React Sketch.app and React Figma using [`react-primitives`](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/react-primitives). Near pixel-perfect parity with the specification.

API inspired by Rebass and built on `styled-system` and `styled-components`.

Supported platforms (with Elemental React and [`react-primitives`](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/react-primitives)):

- `react-dom` – (web: SSR and Gatsby supported with `styled-components`)
- `react-native` – (React Native – Android and iOS)
- `react-sketchapp` – (React Sketch.app – Code acts as the source-of-truth for your design component library.
- `react-figma` – (since the renderer is in alpha, this may be unstable for UI composition/flexbox)
- `react-*` – more platforms to come in the future, e.g. React 360 (VR), React PDF, etc.
